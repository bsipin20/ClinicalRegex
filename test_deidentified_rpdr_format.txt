He was admitted from inthe setting of a rapidly resolving small bowel obstruction but soonafter returning home, he noted rapid recurrence of his symtomsthough not as severe. He reports eating some potatoes and macaronion the day of his discharge home, but since then his nausea andabdominal pain have made it too difficult to eat. He notes mostlyright sided pain. He notes some emesis without hematemesis. He notesome liquid stool and gas in his ostomy since discharge home. Patient partial SBO
resolved and he was feeling better.  However, he developed bacteremia
that was treated but difficult to fully control given multiple
hepatic abscesses that were likely the cause and could not be drained.

SW/Palliative Care were consulted and followed.  Infection was
treated as above.  He was given symptomatic care with PRN Zofran,
Compazine, and Ativan.  Reglan was added for nausea and to aide in
digestions. Ritalin was added for fatigue.  Patient also had left
biliary catheter rescue with placement of 10 F biliary drain placed
and routine exchange of right biliary catheter - 10 F on 8/18. After a long goals of care 
discussion during a family meeting, the decision was made to discharge home with hospice.
Patient and family understand that his multiple liver abscesses are resistent and
difficult to treat especially in the setting of not being able to
drain.  Patient expressed his wish to be home not to pursue further
drainage of the abscess with percutaneous drains placed by IR.  He
understands that there is a risk of recurrent sepsis with this
approach.  Decision was thus made for discharge to home with hospice
services.ROSSee aboveotherwise a review of 10 systems grossly negativeMEDICAL HISTORYMetastatic colon cancerS/P cardiac valve  hypertensionhypothyroidismS/P wound infection  S/P repair disection thoraic aneurysmProstate cancerCerebrovascular accidentCoronary arteriosclerosisSOCIAL HISTORYRemote smokerNo active EtOHFAMILY HISTORYReviewed and noncontributoryALLERGIESLisinoprilCONDITION ON DISCHARGEStableDISCHARGE MEDICATIONSTamsulosin 0.4 MG PO QDMirtazapine (Remeron) 15 MG PO QHS (last dose: 07/29/2014 10:27 PM)Olanzapine Odt (Zyprexa Zydis) (Zyprexa Zydis ) 5 MG PO TID prn [Insomnia, nausea, anxiety ] (last dose: 08/01/2014 09:44 PM)Rx: 5 MG TAB RAPDIS 1 TAB RAPDIS TID Dispense: 90 Tablet(s) Refills: 0Take 5 mg nightly before bed.

Please consultwith your PCP regarding vaccinations.DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONSDiet: Clear liquidsActivity: Activity as toleratedTreatment: At the time of discharge, your care will transition tohospice services. 1. Using G-tube: The g-tube is there in place of the previousnasogastric tube. It allows your stomach to drain, preventing nausea,vomiting and abdominal pain. You should not eat or drink anythinglarger than the tube in order to prevent obstructions (for example,liquids and thin purees are okay). When you take a medicine, swallowit with a sip of water and "clamp" "turn off" your g-tube for 20minutes. This allows the medicine to absorb. After 20 minutes, "open""turn on" the g-tube up and let the fluid drain out.2. Fluid and Electrolytes: Take potassium powder as prescribed daily.Mix this in a small glass of fluid. Again, clamp your tube while itabsorbs. The hospice nurse will assess you daily and may recommendintravenous fluids. You may need intravenous fluids NS 1 L twice perweek.3. Pain: Your PCA will be used for pain relief. Your hospice nurse isavailable to adjust this as needed.4. **Lovenox**- This is very important. You are being discharged on ablood thinner. However, you are also at high risk for bleeding. Ifyou notice any bloody drainage from your g-tube, dark colored stoolsor other signs of bleeding, call the hospice nurse and STOP YOURLOVENOX5. Other symptoms: Zyprexa is a new medication for you which can beused for insomnia, nausea and anxiety. Use 1 tab before bed eachnight. In addition, you can use 1/2 tab to 1 full tab twice duringthe day if needed. Place the tab under your tongue and allow it todissolve.POST-DISCHARGE GOALSContinuity of Care: Please attend all scheduled appointmentsSERVICESHospice Service - Evaluate and Treat Accordingly

100000000|HSP|1000000|3000000|1000000|8/24/2014 12:00:00 AM|ED Discharge Summary|Final|DIS|Associated Diagnosis
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT
Patient is with AI s/p St. Jude AVR, on
therapeutic lovenox, aortic dissection s/p aortic root
replacement, seizure d/o, CVA (no residual), prostate cancer,
hypothyoridism, and metastatic colon cancer who is admitted with recurrent
abdominal pain and nausea.

1. Abdominal pain/Nausea Vomiting: KUB showed distal partial small
bowel obstruction.  Etiology thought
likely mechanical given the location and his known metastatic disease.
 Ostomy continued to pass small amounts of stool and flatus but
abdomen was moderately distended. NGT placement on admission was
attempted but was unsucessful. Given that he was not vomiting at that
time, placement was not reattempted. Pt was seen by surgery
who recommended a conservative approach. Trialed Reglan but this
increased abdominal cramping so was stopped. Diet was slowly advanced.
Abdominal pain became worse. An NGT was placed at this time
and put out large quantities of bilious fluid.  Due to repetitive and
painful nature of his obstructions, IR was consulted for G-tube
placement. Patient able to tolerate sips of clears and clamping g-tube for occasional oral medications at the time of discharge. Due to patient's frequent need for PRN IV pain
medications and inability to tolerate frequent oral medications, a
Dilaudid PCA was started on per Palliative Care.


5. Seizure: Continued keppra

6. Metastatic colon cancer: Patient and his wife acknowledge that he has
only become worse with chemotherapy. In addition, nutrition is
compromised with nonfunctioning GI tract. Palliative care followed throughout admission and was extremely helpful. Pallcare met withp atient and his wife HCP to discuss GOC
discuss lack of meaningful treatment options. Family considered
inpatient hospice but wanted to try hospice at home first.

7. Pneumonia: Pt developed a new O2 requirement.
RA O2 sat was measured to be 85% so he was placed on O2 via nasal
cannula. CXR was obtained and showed "interval development of patchy
right lower lung zone opacity which may represent pneumonia,
aspiration, or atelectasis." He was afebrile but was on steroids.
HCAP treatment was started with Zosyn and Vancomycin. O2 weaned to
room air on 8/1. Respiratory culture showed few enteric GNRs.
Vancomycin was stopped 8/2. Zosyn continued until discharge on 8/5/14.


DISPO: Pt was discharged with home hospice (Care
Dimensions) on 8/5/14. Rx given for new medications (dilaudid PCA,
zyprexa, decadron, potassium, lovenox lower dose) and hospice will
coordinate subsequent needs. Patient may need IVF twice weekly at
home, Care Dimensions is aware and will be able to provide. Teaching
regarding g-tube, PCA, diet, monitoring for bleeding and end of life
issues was done with patient and his wife.
